Hello world!
I'm doing this GitHub tutorial all over again because I got lost during the second half of my Intro to Programming class, so most of the GitHub repository lessons are kind of blurry, although I still remember it as a kind of Google Drive for programmers?

Glad to be back in this world! Since the beginning of the year, I've been juggling SQL, Python, and GDScript, and in the last two months, I feel like I'm finally a better programmer than I was when I struggled through my Intro to Programming class in college. 

I'll mostly be uploading Python code in this repo. I've just finished the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" Udemy course (the full textbook is available for free at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) so most of the code I'll be uploading will be super small and niche, but they've been super helpful in making my work more efficient. As of today, I haven't figured out how to import third-party modules into my work computer, so the first few codes I'll be uploading are all limited to the built-in Python modules (which is quite a fun challenge in and of itself). For data protection reasons, I'll also be altering specific details (like using general variable terms vs. the insider variable terms I might use for the program at work), but this should also make the code potentially useful/usable for the public.

I do want to try to upload some of my game dev GDScript code down the line, but as of today, 1) I'm only making very minor tweaks to the examples I'm getting from my course, so I'm pretty sure uploading it is just plagiarism, and 2) I'm not 100% sure how feasible it'll be to upload here - maybe  just specific scripts? As I get used to GitHub again, I'll probably have a better idea about this.

That's it for now, I'm signing out.

Cheers,\n
Linden
